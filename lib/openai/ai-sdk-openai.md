OpenAI Provider
The OpenAI provider contains language model support for the OpenAI responses, chat, and completion APIs, as well as embedding model support for the OpenAI embeddings API.

Setup
The OpenAI provider is available in the @ai-sdk/openai module. You can install it with

pnpm
npm
yarn
pnpm add @ai-sdk/openai
Provider Instance
You can import the default provider instance openai from @ai-sdk/openai:


import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
If you need a customized setup, you can import createOpenAI from @ai-sdk/openai and create a provider instance with your settings:


import { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const openai = createOpenAI({
  // custom settings, e.g.
  compatibility: 'strict', // strict mode, enable when using the OpenAI API
});
You can use the following optional settings to customize the OpenAI provider instance:

baseURL string

Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers. The default prefix is https://api.openai.com/v1.

apiKey string

API key that is being sent using the Authorization header. It defaults to the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

name string

The provider name. You can set this when using OpenAI compatible providers to change the model provider property. Defaults to openai.

organization string

OpenAI Organization.

project string

OpenAI project.

headers Record<string,string>

Custom headers to include in the requests.

fetch (input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise<Response>

Custom fetch implementation. Defaults to the global fetch function. You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests, or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

compatibility "strict" | "compatible"

OpenAI compatibility mode. Should be set to strict when using the OpenAI API, and compatible when using 3rd party providers. In compatible mode, newer information such as streamOptions are not being sent, resulting in NaN token usage. Defaults to 'compatible'.

Language Models
The OpenAI provider instance is a function that you can invoke to create a language model:


const model = openai('gpt-4-turbo');
It automatically selects the correct API based on the model id. You can also pass additional settings in the second argument:


const model = openai('gpt-4-turbo', {
  // additional settings
});
The available options depend on the API that's automatically chosen for the model (see below). If you want to explicitly select a specific model API, you can use .chat or .completion.

Example
You can use OpenAI language models to generate text with the generateText function:


import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
OpenAI language models can also be used in the streamText, generateObject, and streamObject functions (see AI SDK Core).

Chat Models
You can create models that call the OpenAI chat API using the .chat() factory method. The first argument is the model id, e.g. gpt-4. The OpenAI chat models support tool calls and some have multi-modal capabilities.


const model = openai.chat('gpt-3.5-turbo');
OpenAI chat models support also some model specific settings that are not part of the standard call settings. You can pass them as an options argument:


const model = openai.chat('gpt-3.5-turbo', {
  logitBias: {
    // optional likelihood for specific tokens
    '50256': -100,
  },
  user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
});
The following optional settings are available for OpenAI chat models:

logitBias Record<number, number>

Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

As an example, you can pass {"50256": -100} to prevent the token from being generated.

logprobs boolean | number

Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that were generated.

Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n tokens that were generated.

parallelToolCalls boolean

Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use. Defaults to true.

useLegacyFunctionCalls boolean

Whether to use legacy function calling. Defaults to false.

Required by some open source inference engines which do not support the tools API. May also provide a workaround for parallelToolCalls resulting in the provider buffering tool calls, which causes streamObject to be non-streaming.

Prefer setting parallelToolCalls: false over this option.

structuredOutputs boolean

Whether to use structured outputs. Defaults to false for normal models, and true for reasoning models.

When enabled, tool calls and object generation will be strict and follow the provided schema.

user string

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

downloadImages boolean

Automatically download images and pass the image as data to the model. OpenAI supports image URLs for public models, so this is only needed for private models or when the images are not publicly accessible. Defaults to false.

simulateStreaming boolean

Simulates streaming by using a normal generate call and returning it as a stream. Enable this if the model that you are using does not support streaming. Defaults to false.

reasoningEffort 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'

Reasoning effort for reasoning models. Defaults to medium. If you use providerOptions to set the reasoningEffort option, this model setting will be ignored.

Reasoning
OpenAI has introduced the o1 and o3 series of reasoning models. Currently, o3-mini, o1, o1-mini, and o1-preview are available.

Reasoning models currently only generate text, have several limitations, and are only supported using generateText and streamText.

They support additional settings and response metadata:

You can use providerOptions to set

the reasoningEffort option (or alternatively the reasoningEffort model setting), which determines the amount of reasoning the model performs.
You can use response providerMetadata to access the number of reasoning tokens that the model generated.


import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, usage, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: openai('o3-mini'),
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      reasoningEffort: 'low',
    },
  },
});

console.log(text);
console.log('Usage:', {
  ...usage,
  reasoningTokens: providerMetadata?.openai?.reasoningTokens,
});
System messages are automatically converted to OpenAI developer messages for reasoning models when supported. For models that do not support developer messages, such as o1-preview, system messages are removed and a warning is added.

Reasoning models like o1-mini and o1-preview require additional runtime inference to complete their reasoning phase before generating a response. This introduces longer latency compared to other models, with o1-preview exhibiting significantly more inference time than o1-mini.

maxTokens is automatically mapped to max_completion_tokens for reasoning models.

Structured Outputs
You can enable OpenAI structured outputs by setting the structuredOutputs option to true. Structured outputs are a form of grammar-guided generation. The JSON schema is used as a grammar and the outputs will always conform to the schema.


import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateObject({
  model: openai('gpt-4o-2024-08-06', {
    structuredOutputs: true,
  }),
  schemaName: 'recipe',
  schemaDescription: 'A recipe for lasagna.',
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    ingredients: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        amount: z.string(),
      }),
    ),
    steps: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.object, null, 2));
OpenAI structured outputs have several limitations, in particular around the supported schemas, and are therefore opt-in.

For example, optional schema properties are not supported. You need to change Zod .nullish() and .optional() to .nullable().

PDF support
The OpenAI Chat API supports reading PDF files. You can pass PDF files as part of the message content using the file type:


const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mimeType: 'application/pdf',
          filename: 'ai.pdf', // optional
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
The model will have access to the contents of the PDF file and respond to questions about it. The PDF file should be passed using the data field, and the mimeType should be set to 'application/pdf'.

Predicted Outputs
OpenAI supports predicted outputs for gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini. Predicted outputs help you reduce latency by allowing you to specify a base text that the model should modify. You can enable predicted outputs by adding the prediction option to the providerOptions.openai object:


const result = streamText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'Replace the Username property with an Email property.',
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: existingCode,
    },
  ],
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      prediction: {
        type: 'content',
        content: existingCode,
      },
    },
  },
});
OpenAI provides usage information for predicted outputs (acceptedPredictionTokens and rejectedPredictionTokens). You can access it in the providerMetadata object.


const openaiMetadata = (await result.providerMetadata)?.openai;

const acceptedPredictionTokens = openaiMetadata?.acceptedPredictionTokens;
const rejectedPredictionTokens = openaiMetadata?.rejectedPredictionTokens;
OpenAI Predicted Outputs have several limitations, e.g. unsupported API parameters and no tool calling support.

Image Detail
You can use the openai provider option to set the image generation detail to high, low, or auto:


const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the image in detail.' },
        {
          type: 'image',
          image:
            'https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/examples/ai-core/data/comic-cat.png?raw=true',

          // OpenAI specific options - image detail:
          providerOptions: {
            openai: { imageDetail: 'low' },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
Distillation
OpenAI supports model distillation for some models. If you want to store a generation for use in the distillation process, you can add the store option to the providerOptions.openai object. This will save the generation to the OpenAI platform for later use in distillation.


import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import 'dotenv/config';

async function main() {
  const { text, usage } = await generateText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
    prompt: 'Who worked on the original macintosh?',
    providerOptions: {
      openai: {
        store: true,
        metadata: {
          custom: 'value',
        },
      },
    },
  });

  console.log(text);
  console.log();
  console.log('Usage:', usage);
}

main().catch(console.error);
Prompt Caching
OpenAI has introduced Prompt Caching for supported models including gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, o1-preview, and o1-mini.

Prompt caching is automatically enabled for these models, when the prompt is 1024 tokens or longer. It does not need to be explicitly enabled.
You can use response providerMetadata to access the number of prompt tokens that were a cache hit.
Note that caching behavior is dependent on load on OpenAI's infrastructure. Prompt prefixes generally remain in the cache following 5-10 minutes of inactivity before they are evicted, but during off-peak periods they may persist for up to an hour.

import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, usage, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
  prompt: `A 1024-token or longer prompt...`,
});

console.log(`usage:`, {
  ...usage,
  cachedPromptTokens: providerMetadata?.openai?.cachedPromptTokens,
});
Audio Input
With the gpt-4o-audio-preview model, you can pass audio files to the model.

The gpt-4o-audio-preview model is currently in preview and requires at least some audio inputs. It will not work with non-audio data.


import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o-audio-preview'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'What is the audio saying?' },
        {
          type: 'file',
          mimeType: 'audio/mpeg',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/galileo.mp3'),
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
Responses Models
You can use the OpenAI responses API with the openai.responses(modelId) factory method.


const model = openai.responses('gpt-4o-mini');
Further configuration can be done using OpenAI provider options. You can validate the provider options using the OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions type.


import { openai, OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o-mini'),
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      parallelToolCalls: false,
      store: false,
      user: 'user_123',
      // ...
    } satisfies OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions,
  },
  // ...
});
The following provider options are available:

parallelToolCalls boolean Whether to use parallel tool calls. Defaults to true.

store boolean Whether to store the generation. Defaults to true.

metadata Record<string, string> Additional metadata to store with the generation.

previousResponseId string The ID of the previous response. You can use it to continue a conversation. Defaults to undefined.

instructions string Instructions for the model. They can be used to change the system or developer message when continuing a conversation using the previousResponseId option. Defaults to undefined.

user string A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Defaults to undefined.

reasoningEffort 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' Reasoning effort for reasoning models. Defaults to medium. If you use providerOptions to set the reasoningEffort option, this model setting will be ignored.

strictSchemas boolean Whether to use strict JSON schemas in tools and when generating JSON outputs. Defaults to true.

The OpenAI responses provider also returns provider-specific metadata:


const { providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o-mini'),
});

const openaiMetadata = providerMetadata?.openai;
The following OpenAI-specific metadata is returned:

responseId string The ID of the response. Can be used to continue a conversation.

cachedPromptTokens number The number of prompt tokens that were a cache hit.

reasoningTokens number The number of reasoning tokens that the model generated.

Web Search
The OpenAI responses provider supports web search through the openai.tools.webSearchPreview tool.

You can force the use of the web search tool by setting the toolChoice parameter to { type: 'tool', toolName: 'web_search_preview' }.


const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o-mini'),
  prompt: 'What happened in San Francisco last week?',
  tools: {
    web_search_preview: openai.tools.webSearchPreview({
      // optional configuration:
      searchContextSize: 'high',
      userLocation: {
        type: 'approximate',
        city: 'San Francisco',
        region: 'California',
      },
    }),
  },
  // Force web search tool:
  toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'web_search_preview' },
});

// URL sources
const sources = result.sources;
PDF support
The OpenAI Responses API supports reading PDF files. You can pass PDF files as part of the message content using the file type:


const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mimeType: 'application/pdf',
          filename: 'ai.pdf', // optional
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
The model will have access to the contents of the PDF file and respond to questions about it. The PDF file should be passed using the data field, and the mimeType should be set to 'application/pdf'.

Completion Models
You can create models that call the OpenAI completions API using the .completion() factory method. The first argument is the model id. Currently only gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is supported.


const model = openai.completion('gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct');
OpenAI completion models support also some model specific settings that are not part of the standard call settings. You can pass them as an options argument:


const model = openai.completion('gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct', {
  echo: true, // optional, echo the prompt in addition to the completion
  logitBias: {
    // optional likelihood for specific tokens
    '50256': -100,
  },
  suffix: 'some text', // optional suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text
  user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
});
The following optional settings are available for OpenAI completion models:

echo: boolean

Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion.

logitBias Record<number, number>

Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

As an example, you can pass {"50256": -100} to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

logprobs boolean | number

Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that were generated.

Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n tokens that were generated.

suffix string

The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

user string

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

Embedding Models
You can create models that call the OpenAI embeddings API using the .embedding() factory method.


const model = openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-large');
OpenAI embedding models support several additional settings. You can pass them as an options argument:


const model = openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-large', {
  dimensions: 512 // optional, number of dimensions for the embedding
  user: 'test-user' // optional unique user identifier
})
The following optional settings are available for OpenAI embedding models:

dimensions: number

The number of dimensions the resulting output embeddings should have. Only supported in text-embedding-3 and later models.

user string

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

Model Capabilities
Model	Default Dimensions	Custom Dimensions
text-embedding-3-large	3072	
text-embedding-3-small	1536	
text-embedding-ada-002	1536	
Image Models
You can create models that call the OpenAI image generation API using the .image() factory method.


const model = openai.image('dall-e-3');
Dall-E models do not support the aspectRatio parameter. Use the size parameter instead.

Model Capabilities
Model	Sizes
dall-e-3	1024x1024, 1792x1024, 1024x1792
dall-e-2	256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024
Transcription Models
You can create models that call the OpenAI transcription API using the .transcription() factory method.

The first argument is the model id e.g. whisper-1.


const model = openai.transcription('whisper-1');
OpenAI transcription models support an audio argument which can be a DataContent (string | Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer | Buffer) or a URL.


const model = openai.transcription('whisper-1', {
  audio: new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4]),
});
You can also pass additional provider-specific options using the providerOptions argument. For example, supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 (e.g. en) format will improve accuracy and latency.


import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const result = await transcribe({
  model: openai.transcription('whisper-1'),
  audio: new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4]),
  providerOptions: { openai: { language: 'en' } },
});
The following provider options are available:

timestampGranularities string[] The granularity of the timestamps in the transcription. Defaults to ['segment']. Possible values are ['word'], ['segment'], and ['word', 'segment']. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

language string The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format (e.g. 'en') will improve accuracy and latency. Optional.

prompt string An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language. Optional.

temperature number The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit. Defaults to 0. Optional.

include string[] Additional information to include in the transcription response.

Model Capabilities
